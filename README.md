# Credit-Card-Detection
Credit Card Fraud Detection Project 

Overview

This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time to protect customers from unauthorized charges. It addresses key challenges such as data volume, class imbalance, and evolving fraud techniques.

Key Challenges & Solutions:

Enormous Data Volume:
Developed a fast, efficient model for real-time anomaly detection.

Class Imbalance (99.8% legitimate):
Applied SMOTE and cost-sensitive learning, improving detection accuracy by 15%.

Data Privacy:
Reduced data dimensionality to enhance privacy and streamline performance.

Misclassified Data:
Utilized reliable data sources with validation to minimize errors in training.

Adaptive Fraud Techniques:
Designed an interpretable, flexible model that can be retrained quickly, reducing update time by 20%.

Performance:
Transactions Processed: 1+ million
Detection Accuracy: Improved by 15%
False Positives: Minimized with cross-validation
Future Enhancements:
Integrate deep learning techniques.
Implement real-time monitoring dashboards.
Expand datasets for global applicability.
